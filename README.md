# General Information

## Course Objective

This course provides an overview of “deep neural network” (AKA deep learning) and related methods with applications in computer vision. First, we will overview (continue after CSC 476) some fundamental topics in computer vision such as image formation, camera models, color, signal processing, and statistical modeling of images. Second, we will introduce basic machine learning methods and neural network architectures. Finally, we dive into a variety of deep learning-based applications in computer vision including image classification, video analysis and image synthesis.  Students learn to implement, train, and debug off-the shelf and their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of the cutting-edge research in computer vision. Topics include visual data representation, mid-level vision, image parsing, object recognition with architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative-advisory networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
