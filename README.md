# General Information

## Course Objective

This course provides an overview of “deep neural network” (AKA deep learning) and related methods with applications in computer vision. First, we will overview (continue after CSC 476) some fundamental topics in computer vision such as image formation, camera models, color, signal processing, and statistical modeling of images. Second, we will introduce basic machine learning methods and neural network architectures. Finally, we dive into a variety of deep learning-based applications in computer vision including image classification, video analysis and image synthesis.  Students learn to implement, train, and debug off-the shelf and their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of the cutting-edge research in computer vision. Topics include visual data representation, mid-level vision, image parsing, object recognition with architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative-advisory networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).


## Perquisites

1. Proficiency in Python.  
2. College Calculus
3. Basic probability and statistics

## Course Policy
### Attendence policy

Missing one class without written request will result in 2% reduction in attendance score.   However, students can be absent for class and arrange for make-up exams if they have written proof of religious holidays and documented disabilities. Athlete who would miss class due to sports events must send written form to instructor at least 24 hours before the class. 

### Homework late policy
Projects are due 11:59pm of the due date. You usually have two weeks to finish the assigned project.  

We do not accept late submissions for this course. The submission deadline has a 50-minute soft cut-off; after midnight, submissions are penalized 2% per minute late.  

###Exam Policy
Mid-term exam will be announced at least one week ahead of time. If you have special needs, you need to notify me at least 7 days before to arrange the test be performed off-class in the exam center. Missed exams and quizzes cannot be made up. 

###Email Policy
You can email me if you have questions regarding lectures and homeworks. But you must write to me at least 48 hours to expect an answer. No homework is accepted via Email. Everything must be uploaded onto Blackboard. 

## Grading 
65% homework projects, 10% mid-term exam, 15% Final project, 5% in-class quiz, 5% attendances.  We sometimes offer extra credits for additional features in homework and projects.
